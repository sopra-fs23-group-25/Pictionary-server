# multi-language Pictionary
### SoPra FS23 Group 25

## Introduction
We created a web-based version of Pictionary, a fun draw and guess game, where users play against each other in real-time.  The game can be played in a user's preferred language. We used Google Translate API to allow users with different chosen languages to play together.
